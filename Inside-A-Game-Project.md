A game is simply a collection of files that Pixel Vision 8 loads into its memory. Each of these files has a specific purpose in the project. These are the types of files that can go inside of a game project:

* `.png` - used to store colors, sprites, and even tilemaps.

* `.font.png` - this custom extension is used to store fonts.

* `.json` - used to store system data, tilemaps, sounds, music, and metadata.

PV8 will ignore any additional files in a project that it doesnâ€™t know how to load or edit.
