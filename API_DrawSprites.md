# DrawSprites

The DrawSprites method makes it easier to combine and draw groups of sprites to the display in a grid. This is useful when trying to render 4 sprites together as a larger 16x16 pixel graphic. While there is no limit on the size of the sprite group which can be rendered, it is important to note that each sprite in the array still counts as an individual sprite. Sprites passed into the DrawSprites() method are visible if the display can render it. Under the hood, this method uses DrawSprite but solely manages positioning the sprites out in a grid. Another unique feature of his helper method is that it automatically hides sprites that go offscreen. When used with overscan border, it greatly simplifies drawing larger sprites to the display.

## Usage

`DrawSprites ( ids, x, y, width, flipH, flipV, drawMode, int colorOffset, bool onScreen, bool useScrollPos, Rectangle? bounds )`

## Arguments

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>Value</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ids</td>
    <td>int[]</td>
    <td>An array of sprite IDs to display on the screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>x</td>
    <td>int</td>
    <td>An int value representing the X position to place sprite on the display. If set to 0, it renders on the far left-hand side of the screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>y</td>
    <td>int</td>
    <td>An int value representing the Y position to place sprite on the display. If set to 0, it renders on the top of the screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>width</td>
    <td>int</td>
    <td>The width, in sprites, of the grid. A value of 2 renders 2 sprites wide. The DrawSprites method continues to run through all of the sprites in the ID array until reaching the end. Sprite groups do not have to be perfect squares since the width value is only used to wrap sprites to the next row.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>flipH</td>
    <td>bool</td>
    <td>This is an optional argument which accepts a bool. The default value is set to false but passing in true flips the pixel data horizontally.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>flipV</td>
    <td>bool</td>
    <td>This is an optional argument which accepts a bool. The default value is set to false but passing in true flips the pixel data vertically.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>drawMode</td>
    <td>DrawMode</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>colorOffset</td>
    <td>int</td>
    <td>This optional argument accepts an int that offsets all the color IDs in the pixel data array. This value is added to each int, in the pixel data array, allowing you to simulate palette shifting.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>onScreen</td>
    <td>bool</td>
    <td>This flag defines if the sprites should not render when they are off the screen. Use this in conjunction with overscan border control what happens to sprites at the edge of the display. If this value is false, the sprites wrap around the screen when they reach the edges of the screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>useScrollPos</td>
    <td>bool</td>
    <td>This will automatically offset the sprite's x and y position based on the scroll value.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>bounds</td>
    <td>Rectangle</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
