The Pixel Vision 8 has a built-in tilemap editor which is designed to help you build levels, splash screens, and backgrounds for your games.

The tilemap editor is broken up into 4 main parts: the sprite picker, the color/flag picker, the tools, and the tilemap editor. In addition to the tilemap editor, you can use the Tilemap Tool to create collision flags by switching over to the flag picker.
