The `PlaySong()` API allows you to activate the `MusicChip`â€™s tracker to playback any of the songs stored in memory. A song is simply a collection of patterns. You can supply an optional parameter called `startAt` to tell the `MusicChip` which pattern to start the song at. When playing a song, you will need to supply a song ID, which starts at `0`. The total number of songs is defined in the `data.json` file.

## Usage

`PlaySong ( id, loop, startAt )`

## Arguments

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>Value</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>id</td>
    <td>int</td>
    <td>The ID of the song you want to play.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>loop</td>
    <td>bool</td>
    <td>Tell the MusicChip if it should replay the song once all of the loops have finished playing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>startAt</td>
    <td>int</td>
    <td>An optional parameter that tells the MusicChip which pattern to start playing in the song.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


## Example

In this example, we are going to play a song when the mouse button is released and display the song data:

    class PlaySongExample : GameChip
    {
        private int isPlaying;

        public override void Update(int timeDelta)
        { 
            // Get the playing value
            isPlaying = SongData()["playing"];

            // Test if the left mouse button was released && if isPlaying equals 0
            if(MouseButton(0, InputState.Released) && isPlaying == 0)
            { 

                // Play the first song without looping
                PlaySong(0, false);

            }
        }

        public override void Draw()
        { 

            // Redraw display
            RedrawDisplay();

            // Reset the next row value so we know where to draw the first line of text
            var nextRow = 2;

            if (isPlaying == 1)
            {

                // Draw the song data label
                DrawText("Song Data:", 8, 8, DrawMode.Sprite, "large", 15);

                // Display the song's meta data
                foreach (var data in SongData())
                {

                    // Draw the key value pair from the song data table
                    DrawText(data.Key + ":", 8, nextRow * 8, DrawMode.Sprite, "large", 6);
                    DrawText(data.Value.ToString(), 16 + (data.Key.Length * 8), nextRow * 8, DrawMode.Sprite, "large",
                        14);

                    // Increment the row by 1 for the next loop
                    nextRow ++;

                }
            } else { 

                // Draw the instructions label
                DrawText("Click To Play Song", 8, 8, DrawMode.Sprite, "large", 15);

            }
        }
    }

Running this code will output the following:
