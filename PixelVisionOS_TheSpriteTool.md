# Sprite Tool

The Sprite Editor Tool allows you to preview and edit sprites in memory. This tool is critical to see all of the sprites that are imported into the game and verifying that they are displayed correctly. Let's take a look at the Sprite Editor Tool's default layout.

The tool is broken down into 3 parts: the sprite editor, the sprite picker, and the color picker. Letâ€™s get started by talking about the picker. This tool is rather straightforward. Simply select a sprite you would like to edit and it will load up on the canvas. Use the tools to modify it, and once saved, the sprites.png file will be updated with the changes.
