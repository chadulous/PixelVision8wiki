Pixel Vision OS displays a special drive on your desktop called Workspace. This drive is automatically created as a folder on your computer’s filesystem.

You can see the workspace path on your computer from the drop-down menu by selecting About.

You can use Pixel Vision OS or your computer’s file system to create folders, add PV8 games or create files in the Workspace folder. Any changes you make on you’re computer will show up in Pixel Vision OS’s Workspace drive.

If you have a PV8 game in your workspace, which is just a zip file ending in `.pv8`, it will show up as a disk image.

To run the game or make changes to it, double click on the disk and it will be mounted on the desktop. From here, you can play the game by double-clicking on the Run icon, edit any of the files, or copy it to the Workspace to work on it without having to remount the disk.

One of the advantages of the Workspace is allowing you the option to use external text and image editors when making PV8 games. Changes you make on your computer can be reloaded while running a game or tool by pressing `Ctrl + 4`. Feel free to use whatever tools you are comfortable with when creating PV8 games. The workflow was designed to be open so you can be as productive as possible.
