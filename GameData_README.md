# Inside a Game Project

A game is simply a collection of files that Pixel Vision 8 loads into its memory. Each of these files has a specific purpose in the project. 

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/InsideAGameProject_image_0.png" /></p>

In order for a game to load correctly, you need at least the following files:

1. data.json

2. code.lua

3. info.json

All the other files are optional.
