The canvas is a special `TextureData` derivative that supports drawing primitive shapes such as lines, circles, and rectangles. You can also draw sprites and text to it as well. When you are done drawing on the canvas, you can copy the pixel data into the `SpriteChip `or directly to the tilemap cache. While the canvas allows run-time drawing, itâ€™s not part of the core Pixel Vision 8 API. The canvas is used to create the tilemap cache and the additional drawing APIs, which are used by Pixel Vision OS, should be used sparingly since they could impact performance.

In order to draw on the canvas, you first need to set a stroke that represents the size of the brush and color to use. You can also set a pattern that is used to fill primitives such as the circle and rectangle. These patterns could be solid colors or graphics that will repeat within the boundaries of the shape. Each time you change the stroke or pattern, the next primitive that is drawn will reflect the changes.

## Drawing APIs

The Canvas has its own set of drawing APIs that allow you to draw pixel data to it. These are a few of the more common ones you can use.

| Name                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Example

In this example, we are going to look at how to draw a line, a circle, and a square including how to fill them with solid colors or patterns:



## Lua

```lua
-- Create a new canvas the size of the display
local canvas = NewCanvas(Display().x, Display().y)

-- This will be our solid pattern value
local solidPattern = {5}

-- This will be our checkered pattern value
local checkeredPattern = {
  5, 0, 5, 0,
  0, 5, 0, 5,
  5, 0, 5, 0,
  0, 5, 0, 5
}

function Init()

  -- Set the canvas stroke to a 1x1 pixel brush
  canvas:SetStroke({6}, 1, 1)

  -- Draw the line label to the canvas
  canvas:DrawText("Line", 8, 8, "large", 15)

  -- Draw a line between the two points
  canvas:DrawLine(8, 24, 80, 32)

  -- Change the spacing between the line's x pixels to 2 for a dotted line
  canvas:LinePattern(2, 0)

  -- Draw a line between the two points
  canvas:DrawLine(93, 24, 165, 32)

  -- Reset the space between the line's pixels back to 1
  canvas:LinePattern(1, 0)

  -- Draw the circle label to the canvas
  canvas:DrawText("Circle", 8, 40, "large", 15)

  -- Circle 1
  canvas:DrawCircle(8, 80, 64, 80)

  -- Circle 2
  canvas:SetPattern(solidPattern, 1, 1)
  canvas:DrawCircle(74, 80, 130, 80, true)

  -- Circle 3
  canvas:SetPattern(checkeredPattern, 4, 4)
  canvas:DrawCircle(140, 80, 196, 80, true)

  -- Draw the square label to the canvas
  canvas:DrawText("Square", 8, 120, "large", 15)

  -- Square 1
  canvas:DrawSquare(8, 136, 64, 192)

  -- Square 2
  canvas:SetPattern(solidPattern, 1, 1)
  canvas:DrawSquare(76, 136, 132, 192, true)

  -- Square 3
  canvas:SetPattern(checkeredPattern, 4, 4)
  canvas:DrawSquare(142, 136, 198, 192, true)

  -- Draw the canvas to the display
  canvas:DrawPixels()

end

function Draw()
  -- Redraw the display
  RedrawDisplay()
end
```



## C#

```csharp

    // Store a reference to the canvas here
    private Canvas canvas;

    // This will be our solid pattern value
    private int[] solidPattern = {5};

    private int[] checkeredPattern =
    {
        5, 0, 5, 0,
        0, 5, 0, 5,
        5, 0, 5, 0,
        0, 5, 0, 5
    };

    public override void Init()
    { 
        // Create a new canvas the size of the display
        canvas = NewCanvas(Display().X, Display().Y);

        // Set the canvas stroke to a 1x1 pixel brush
        canvas.SetStroke(new int[]{ 6}, 1, 1);

        // Draw the line label to the canvas
        canvas.DrawText("Line", 8, 8, "large", 15);

        // Draw a line between the two points
        canvas.DrawLine(8, 24, 80, 32);

        // Change the spacing between the line's x pixels to 2 for a dotted line
        canvas.LinePattern(2, 0);

        // Draw a line between the two points
        canvas.DrawLine(93, 24, 165, 32);

        // Reset the space between the line's pixels back to 1
        canvas.LinePattern(1, 0);

        // Draw the circle label to the canvas
        canvas.DrawText("Circle", 8, 40, "large", 15);

        // Circle 1
        canvas.DrawCircle(8, 80, 64, 80);

        // Circle 2
        canvas.SetPattern(solidPattern, 1, 1);
        canvas.DrawCircle(74, 80, 130, 80, true);

        // Circle 3
        canvas.SetPattern(checkeredPattern, 4, 4);
        canvas.DrawCircle(140, 80, 196, 80, true);

        // Draw the square label to the canvas
        canvas.DrawText("Square", 8, 120, "large", 15);

        // Square 1
        canvas.DrawSquare(8, 136, 64, 192);

        // Square 2
        canvas.SetPattern(solidPattern, 1, 1);
        canvas.DrawSquare(76, 136, 132, 192, true);

        // Square 3
        canvas.SetPattern(checkeredPattern, 4, 4);
        canvas.DrawSquare(142, 136, 198, 192, true);

        // Draw the canvas to the display
        canvas.DrawPixels();

    }

    public override void Draw()
    { 
        // Redraw the display
        RedrawDisplay();
    }

}
```
