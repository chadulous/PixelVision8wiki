Pixel Vision 8 supports playing sound effects at runtime. These SFX files are based on [Sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html) and are stored in the `sounds.json` file. Each game can store a specific amount of sound effects and each one can be played back on one of the available sound channels. Each channel can be configured to playback any supported waveform or can be locked to only playback a specific type in order to create a sound system that closely resembles older 8-bit system limitations.
