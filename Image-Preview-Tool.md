Pixel Vision OS has a built-in image viewer. You can use it to open any `.png` file that is not associated with an editor. You can tell a file will be opened by the Image Preview Tool if it has the generic PNG icon.

After double-clicking on a file ending in `.png`, the Image Preview Tool will display it. If the image is larger than the preview window, you’ll be able to scroll horizontally or vertically via the scroll bars on the right and bottom of the tool.

It’s important to note that special image files such as the `colors.png`, `sprite.png` and `tilemap.png` file will be opened with their respective editors if they are inside of a game project folder.
