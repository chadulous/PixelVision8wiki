# Draw Multiple Sprites

In addition to drawing one sprite at a time, you can also draw multiple sprites to the screen in a grid to help with rendering larger items. Simply use the `DrawSprites()` method. This method accepts an array of sprite IDs along with a width to render it correctly to the display. You can see full examples of how to draw sprites to the display in the Draw Sprite Demo:

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="images/DrawMultipleSprites_image_0.png" /></p>

If you lay out your sprites in blocks, you can use the DrawSpriteBlock() to render them to the display in chunks.

Be sure to check out the demos for more examples of how to render sprites to the display.
