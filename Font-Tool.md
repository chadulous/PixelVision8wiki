The Font Tool, which is installed as part of the Pro Tools, allows you to view and modify Pixel Vision 8 sprite fonts. The Font Tool shows you how a font’s characters map to these ASCII character ID so you can make sure they will display correctly.

The Font Tool consists of a character picker, a canvas, a char picker, a letter-spacing field for testing and a preview area to see what the font will look like at runtime. Simply use the Char input field or click on the character in the picker to load it in the canvas for editing. All font characters are 8 x 8 pixels but you can design smaller fonts and use the spacing input field to see how they will work.
