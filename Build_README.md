# Building Pixel Vision 8

The core of Pixel Vision 8 is open source. You can download the project from the [Pixel Vision 8 Github repo](http://github.com/PixelVision8/pixelVision8/). This project contains everything you need to build a bare-bones C# and Lua runner, as well as a Game Runner and the full version of Pixel Vision 8. You’ll need a tool that can compile Mono such as Visual Studio ([Win](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)/[Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/)) or [Jetbrains’ Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).
