# Pixel Vision SDK

Pixel Vision 8's core philosophy is to teach retro game development with streamlined workflows. It enables designing games around limited resolutions, colors, sprites, sound, and memory. It is ideal for game jams, prototyping ideas or having fun. You have full control over these limitations. The SDK simply provides a [standard set of APIs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-HeQnHR8hp8GC_gudwFoi4-ipwM7TI1MyZ1g86QLZUg/edit#) to create more authentic 8-bit games with modern programming languages and workflows.

PV8 is also a platform that standardizes 8-bit fantasy console limitations built on top of the open-source [Pixel Vision SDK](http://pixelvisionsdk.com). Developers can customize these restrictions to match actual legacy hardware or create something new. The challenge of working within these confines forces creativity and limits the scope. Pixel Vision 8 creations are expressions of ingenuity that rise above their limitations. 

These limitations include:

* Memory and game size

* Color palettes 

* System colors

* Colors per sprite

* Number of sprites on screen

* Scrolling tilemap

* and more
