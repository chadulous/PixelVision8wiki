# What Is Pixel Vision 8

Pixel Vision 8 is a Fantasy Console that simulates imaginary 8-bit hardware. Out of the box, you can play PV8 games. However, PV8 can also help you create games with limited resolutions, colors, sprites, sound, and memory.

## Playing Games

Pixel Vision 8 supports playing games with keyboard or controllers. Games can also save their progress and are self-contained. You can share PV8 games with your friends that also have a copy of Pixel Vision 8.

## Insert A Disk

Pixel Vision 8 is like a real game console. Just drop any PV8 disk file onto the window and watch it load up! Each disk can contain a single game or a collection of games. You can even have one game load another game inside the same disk to create more significant experiences.
