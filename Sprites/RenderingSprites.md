# Rendering Sprites

You can draw sprites to the display via the `DrawSprite()` method. This method requires a sprite ID as well as an x and y position for where to place the sprite on the screen. By default, the display wraps sprite so if you draw a sprite to an `x` or `y` position past the displayâ€™s dimensions, it part of it will appear on the opposite side of the screen.

When rendering a sprite to the display, there are two optional boolean flags for flipping the sprite horizontally or vertically.

Next, you can define if the sprite appears above or below the background layer. Here is an example of a pip sprite on the tilemap layer and the player in front and behind of it.
