# System Limitations

Pixel Vision 8 is the only fantasy console that allows you to configure each game’s limitations to match your own needs. While there are hard limits that the `PixelVisionEngine` will enforce, you’ll find that PV8 can be adapted to be easier to work with for new developers or locked down to create a challenge closer to the real limitations found on the original 8-bit consoles. Since each game has its own data.json file, these limitations are specific to that game and simply instruct Pixel Vision 8 how to run.

It’s important to understand that Pixel Vision 8’s limitations are rule-based, meaning they are more like guidelines on how the core engine should work. PV8 was designed to make developing games with limitations fun but not limiting. That means if your game increases in scope or you find the constraints to hard to work within, you can change them at any time.

The goal is to have fun and make Pixel Vision 8 work exactly how you want it to.
