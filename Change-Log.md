# Change Log

Pixel Vision 8 and the Pixel Vision OS are constantly being updated based on the new feature backlog, bugs that need fixing and optimizing the underlying codebase. Because of this, the goal is to release new versions as often as possible. If you are new to Pixel Vision 8 or looking to understand what has changed since the last release, you can find the most recent changes below, broken down by the version number.

> Make sure that you backup your Workspace before you install a new version off Pixel Visoin 8. You may also want to make a backup of your bios.json file and load Pixel Vision 8 in safe mode, by holding down the left shift key, when booting up for the first time.
