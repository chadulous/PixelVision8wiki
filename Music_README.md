# Patterns and Songs

Pixel Vision 8 allows the playback of music at runtime. A song is a collection of patterns. Each pattern can contain up to 32 notes across 5 channels. The total amount of channels is determined by the `SoundChip`â€™s `totalChannels` property in the `data.json` file. A song can contain up to 100 patterns. All of this is stored in the `music.jso`n file.
