My name is [Jesse Freeman](http://twitter.com/jessefreeman) and ever since I turned on my Nintendo for the first time, I have wanted to make games! While the technology has changed since the '80s, my desire to make 8-bit games hasn't. I wanted a way to make authentic retro games but with modern tools and workflows. This is how I came up with the idea for Pixel Vision 8.

I hope you enjoy using Pixel Vision 8 and making fun 8-bit games!
