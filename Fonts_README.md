# Fonts

Pixel Vision 8 also supports loading sprite fonts into memory. Each font should be saved with a `.font.png` extension. PV8 fonts are similar to the` sprites.png` but you can actually have multiple fonts in a single game project. Each font character is 8 x 8 pixels and goes into any of the `FontChip`'s free memory slots. By default, there is room for 512 unique sprite characters in the `FontChip`â€™s memory.
